Dear Niraj:
 
I saw your patient, XXXXXXXXXXXXX, in the Cardiology Office today
and he seems like he is improved. He feels his legs are better and
that he can walk greater distances. He feels very comfortable. 
 
His current medications include Metoprolol 50 mg per day,
Nifedipine XL 60 mg per day, Lasix 20 mg per day. 
 
On exam today, he has a blood pressure of 146/76, a heart rate of
65 and regular. Weight 210 pounds. Head and neck unremarkable.
Chest is clear. Cardiac exam is notable for an S4 and a I/VI
systolic ejection murmur. The rest of his exam was unremarkable.
 
Resting 12 lead electrocardiogram is unchanged demonstrating normal
sinus rhythm and a left axis deviation. There is a nonspecific
intraventricular conduction delay. 
 
I think Mr. XXXXX is doing very well. He would like to have his
arterial pulses rechecked noninvasively and I tried to arrange that
schedule. In addition, his Metoprolol has been only once a day and
if he can tolerate it twice a day he will have a better control and
more prolonged risk prevention. I suggest that we increase it to 50
mg bid. I also told him how to take his pulse and he can keep an
eye on it. If it drops too low we can reduce the dose. He asked
that I see him again in about six months for routine re-evaluation
and I will be happy to do so. If any problems develop in the
interim please do not hesitate to contact me. 
 
Thank you for allowing me to help with his care. 
 
Kindest regards.
